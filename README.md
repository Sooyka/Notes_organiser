# Notes_organiser

Simple notes organiser for quickly taking notes.
Made for not having many wirdly named files in the home catalog.

# Motivation

Often I found myself in the situation where there are files named: "a", "ab", "abc", "abcd", "abcdefgh", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa", "aaaaaaaaaa" 
in my home directory.
